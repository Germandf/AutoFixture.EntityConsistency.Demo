# AutoFixture Entity Consistency Demo

This repository demonstrates using AutoFixture to ensure entity consistency in complex object graphs. It customizes the creation of `City` and `CityInfo` entities, making sure relationships (like matching IDs) are handled automatically.

This is an example repository, and it's not fully complete yet, as `the last two tests need to be fixed`. Additionally, `the code above the designated comment should not be modified` to ensure that the customizations are functioning as expected.
